# DualTokenTest
Test Contracts for the Dual-Token Model of Yeti-Apes.


Yeti-Apes utilizes a dual-token governance and utility model to support the future growth and long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.
The two tokens are as follows:

​- Yoints (Purpose: Governance, Total Supply: 100,000,000): Ensures holders are integral to the Yeti-Apes decision-making process, giving them the ability to both submit and vote on proposals for the future growth and direction of the Yeti-Apes ecosystem.

​- Yapes (Purpose: Governance Expansion and Utility, Total Supply: 21,000,000): Critical utility token that is intended to be used across every developed ecosystem product and be the predominant pathway to increasing governance rights in the ecosystem. This ensures users of the ecosystem are the decision makers.
